Executable python files (in order of execution)

average.py goes through a directory and finds good candidates for using as tiles
it saves them under directory/good together with an info image showing why they were chosen


build_index.py creates the color search index given a comma separated list of directories and a tag (for the name of the index)

pic.py can create the photo mosaic for a given picture (together with a color search index pickle file as an argument)
